/* This script was created by Samuel Rose for the GIMMStudio space, focused for quests.
 * 
 * The purpose of this script is to manage the interactivity for Jeanne's space.
 * The idea is to solve three questions based on 80s songs. A clip will play
 * and the player has to figure out the final word or phrase of the snippet.
 * After three correct answers, the prize will be awarded to them.
 * Songs used: immigrant song - led zeppelin
 *              take it easy - eagles
 *              gimme three steps - lynyrd skynyrd
 *              
 * Biodigital jazz, man
